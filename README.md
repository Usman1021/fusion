## A Fusion-Guided Inception Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
The fusion of low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSIs) with high-spatial-resolution conventional images (e.g., panchromatic, RGB) has significantly contributed to recent advancements in HSI super-resolution. However, this method relies on the precise alignment of the image pair, which is often challenging to achieve in practical applications. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a fusion-guided Inception network (FGIN) that integrates multi-branch Inception layers, dilated convolution fusion, and spectral-spatial feature learning without requiring any additional data sources. Specifically, our model leverages Inception-based hierarchical feature extraction to capture multi-scale spatial dependencies, while dilated convolution fusion effectively integrates spatial and spectral features without compromising resolution. Additionally, a spectral-spatial fusion block is employed to emphasize global spectral consistency and local spatial coherence. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we employ an adaptive upsampling module with depthwise convolution and transposed convolution. Moreover, a custom loss function combining L2 regularization and spatial-spectral gradient loss is implemented to ensure accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental evaluations on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets demonstrate its competitive performance.
